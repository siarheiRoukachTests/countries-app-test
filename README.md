This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Countries-app-TEST

To start:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

A little FAQ:

1)Why Redux Toolkit:

### `saves time and have almost all the necessary package from scratch for test projects`

2)Why React i18next:

### `No restrictions and provides best api to set up internationalization`

3)Why MaterialUI:

### `No restrictions and provides quite good api to create ui`

4)Why I didn't handle response errors in a standart way:

### `Main reason is that api is public and uncontrollable, so it's useless to handle it by messages and any other statuses`
